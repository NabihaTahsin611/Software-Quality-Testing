Such a system not only supports the visibility and creativity of artists but also encourages innovation by providing tools for interaction, discovery, and transaction for which all in one unified platform. 
In the documentation, for system interface designing, Figma is used to make a prototype of “Digital Canvas Hub” at first. And for backend and frontend development, these languages can be used- Html, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL. For that, the software tools are- Visual studio code, XAMMP, GitHub. As for the automated testing for this system, Selenium can be used in terms of automated testing. Other than manual testing, Selenium will be of great use for enabling tests of web functionalities and quality attributes assurance while maintaining interface and feature performance together.
